# Assignment 1 - VBA Challenge

## Background

First project of my exciting journey to becoming a data analyst!

The focus of this project was to use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

### Part 1

* Created a script that loops through all the stock data and take the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each individual ticker

* Conditional formatting will also highlight the positive and negative changes in the yearly change column

### Part 2

The second part of this exercise was an optional challenge which required a completed part 1

* Created a script that loops through solutions from part 1 and returns greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume

### Part 3

* These scripts were made to work on a single sheet of stock data, and the script was therefore modified to be able to run on a larger spreadsheet containing multiple sheets of data
