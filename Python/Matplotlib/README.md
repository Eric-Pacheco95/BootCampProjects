# Assignment 4 - Matplotlib Challenge

## Background

Visuals! Can't have data analysis without the visuals. This challenge was a great intro into data analysis visualization.

Pymaceuticals has several drug regimens which treat tumor growth. The purpose of this challenge was to analyze data on these drug regimens and their effect on animals. After analysis, some visualizations using matplotlib were made to showcase the findings

### Tasks

* Generated a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen

* Generated a bar plot using both pandas and matplotlib which shows the number of data points for each drug regimen

* Generated a pie plot using both pandas and matplotlib which shows the distribution of female and male mice in the study

* Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse for four drug regimens. Calculated the quartiles and IQR and determined if there's potential outliers

* Generated a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for four drug regimens

* Generated a line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin

* Generated a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin

* Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plotted the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot

Three Observations made:

Capomulin seems to be effective for treating tumors as shown by the single mouse b128 being treated with Capomulin and having their tumor size being reduced over time.

The Mouse Weight vs Average tumor volume graph shows that on average as the mouse weight increases, the tumor volume also increases.

The Drugs Ketapril and Naftisol have relatively high std.dev and variance as compared to a drug like Capomulin. This could mean this drug requires more testing to retrieve more standardized results.
